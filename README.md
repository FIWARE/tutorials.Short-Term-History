This tutorial is an introduction to [FIWARE STH-Comet](https://fiware-sth-comet.readthedocs.io/) - a generic enabler which is used to retrieve trend data from a Mongo-DB database. The tutorial activates the IoT sensors connected in the [previous tutorial](https://github.com/Fiware/tutorials.IoT-Agent) and persists measurements from those sensors into a database and retrieves time-based aggregations of that data.

The tutorial uses [cUrl](https://ec.haxx.se/) commands throughout, but is also available as [Postman documentation](http://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Historic-Context/)
